# Plant-Disease-Classification

This project uses Sugar Cane diseased and healthy photos and works the following way:
- First the image dataset are categorised
- The image features are extracted
- Then run those features through the neural network
- Using this model we can get a category of the leaf (YLD, Red Spots, Healthy, ..)
